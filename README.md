# hello-world
This is my first repository GitHub. I'll do my best 

Currently, I'm a master student at University of Indonesia. My major is Economics science but actaually I'm interesting more at programming stuff.
So I decided to learn a programming language, and my first programming language is python. I hope I could master it.
